# RemoteMailbox

Powershell script to set up remote mailboxes on an on-prem exchanmge server while in a hybrid MS365 configuration.

## ToDo

### GUI
  Would love to include a GUI with this. Especially at a larger company that has many new hires a week or even a day. Requiring a lot of input.
  This is the logic of it looping.
